.SH NAME
powermate \- control alsa/mpd/pianobar with a griffin powermate
.SH SYNOPSIS
powermate uses the haskell-powermate bindings to control Alsa, MPD and Pianobar with a Griffin PowerMate, supporting long presses and twist motions.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Controls volume and LED brightness with a left or right turn (down, up respectively).
Skips to next MPD/Pianobar track with a press and twist (turn right immediately after pressing).
Mutes with a long press (> 1 second).
.SH NOTES
This program needs read and write access to /dev/input/event*. It acquires this with a udev rule matching all /dev/input/event* files and assigning them to group input with 660 permissions. To use the program you must be a member of group input. Use `sudo gpasswd -a $(whoami) input` to add yourself to this group, and cycle your login for this to take affect.
.SH EXAMPLE
This program can be easily called with `powermate`, and is recommended to be launched with your login or X start.
